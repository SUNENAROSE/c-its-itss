# C-ITS ITS-S Reference implementation

This is a reference implementation of the ITS-S (a client side) as defined in ETSI C-ITS standards.
Its main purpose is to enable implementators of the ITS-S software to study and validate their implementations from a security perspective.
The server side (Enrollment Authority, Authorization Authority and Certification Authority) is provided by TeskaLabs' SeaCat CA.
It also contains a simple [ITS-G5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11p) network simulator that utilizes UDP IPv4 multicast.

Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) allow road users and traffic managers to share information and use it to coordinate their actions.
It is a set of standards that describes data exchange between high-speed vehicles and between the vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, so called V2X communication.
